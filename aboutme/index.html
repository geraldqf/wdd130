        Hi my friends! I´m married to my better half, Emma, and have 3 amazing children. I am 
        from Lima, Perú, at South America. Here almost never rain, but most of days are foggy and we are close to the beach so it is a fun place in summer.

        I am pursuing the web and computer programming certificate, because I saw plenty of opportunities to automate manual processes in the engineering design field.

        I have been a member of church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints for 36 years. My wife and I are enjoying watch our kids growing at church, for example last sunday my oldest son, who is getting 12 years old this year, had his first time passing the sacrament.

        I enjoy playing the piano, is a hobby that got me the opportunity to serve as a church´s pianist and met my wife at the stake choir. I welcome getting to know all of you. Thank you for looking at my web page.
